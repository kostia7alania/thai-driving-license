# Production deployment

Reviewed against repository configuration and public release on 2026-10-03. This is a deployment
runbook; the exact verified public state is recorded separately. See
[PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md) for verification limits.

The implemented brand is Thai Driving License. The first canonical is the free
Cloudflare `workers.dev` origin. `thai-driving-license.com` is an optional later
purchase, not a launch dependency.

Verified production state on 2026-10-03:

- URL: `https://thai-driving-license.kostia7alania.workers.dev`
- application commit: `3b979e74bbc7a87f0ebaf7b588fff19d3bd8f0f4`
- Cloudflare version: `80f23deb-128a-4f25-bc82-4cada7d10707` (100%, tag `astro-3b979e7`)
- previous rollback version: `15fb0b66-9b31-4925-a1dd-3565eb89530c`
- KV namespace: `8d0e349135304e819bf5dd5da489c5f4`
- cron: `17 */6 * * *` (UTC)

## Current zero-cost edge MVP

```text
browser ----> Cloudflare Worker + Static Assets (workers.dev)
                           |
                           +----> Workers KV (one office snapshot)
                           |
                           +----> DLT getSite/2 (cron or cooled manual refresh)
```

Static licence, guide and office pages need no runtime database.
`/v1/dlt/offices` and `/v1/dlt/snapshots/offices` read the latest validated KV
snapshot or the committed 218-entry fallback. `POST /v1/dlt/offices/refresh`
may contact DLT once per 30 minutes across successful and failed attempts. The
UTC cron `17 */6 * * *` runs four times per day.

The browser never calls DLT directly. The response paths match the Go API so a
later BFF can replace the Worker without changing frontend consumers. Work
types, slots, comparison and history are deliberately not reimplemented here.

### Build and deploy

Use the exact public origin, without a trailing slash, for the production build:

```bash
cd apps/web
npm ci
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL='https://thai-driving-license.kostia7alania.workers.dev' \
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL='' NEXT_PUBLIC_SLOT_TOOLS_ENABLED='false' npm run build
cd ../..
make worker-types
npx --yes wrangler@4.135.0 deploy
```

`wrangler.jsonc` binds `OFFICE_SNAPSHOTS`, serves `apps/web/out`, routes API and
health requests through Worker code, and keeps normal pages on the Static Assets
path. `worker-configuration.d.ts` is generated, not edited.

After deploy, verify:

```bash
curl -I 'https://thai-driving-license.kostia7alania.workers.dev/'
curl 'https://thai-driving-license.kostia7alania.workers.dev/healthz'
curl 'https://thai-driving-license.kostia7alania.workers.dev/v1/dlt/snapshots/offices'
curl -X POST 'https://thai-driving-license.kostia7alania.workers.dev/v1/dlt/offices/refresh'
```

The first POST may update KV. An immediate second POST must return
`refresh_status: cooldown` with the same `fetched_at`. An upstream failure must
keep the prior offices and return a truthful `refresh_error`.

### Free-plan boundary

The checked Astro export contains 282 static asset files. Cloudflare Free
limits allow 20,000 static asset files per version, five Cron Triggers per
account, 100,000 Worker requests per day, and KV allowances of 100,000 reads,
1,000 writes and 1 GB storage as documented on 2026-09-21, not freshly audited
by the October framework release. Static asset requests
are free and unlimited under the current product terms. Four cron writes plus
bounded manual refreshes are far below those quotas.

These are provider terms, not a perpetual-price guarantee. Do not add D1, R2,
analytics writes, per-user KV keys or slot polling without a fresh cost review.

### Recovery and account transfer

The committed office JSON is the disaster fallback and the Worker is stateless
apart from one reconstructible KV value. From a clean clone, install and build
with the target origin. If the Cloudflare account changes, create a new KV
namespace, replace its non-secret ID in `wrangler.jsonc`, regenerate types and
deploy. Losing KV affects freshness, not the static site or recovery source.

### Future custom domain

When a domain is bought, rebuild with its HTTPS origin in
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`. This changes canonicals, sitemap, Open Graph URLs and
robots references together. Keep the `workers.dev` host reachable while search
engines process the new canonical, then add a permanent host redirect or disable
the old host after migration is verified. Never redirect the fallback host to an
expired custom domain.

## Future full BFF reference architecture

```text
Cloudflare Pages (static files)
        |
        | browser HTTPS
        v
Google Cloud Run (Go API) ----> external DLT API
        |
        v
managed PostgreSQL (pooled TLS connection)
```

This remains the full path for live slot discovery and durable history. The
following sections apply when that BFF is promoted; they are not requirements
for the zero-cost office-directory release.

## 1. PostgreSQL

Create a production database with TLS and provider-managed backups. Use the
provider's pooled application connection string when available, and keep its
region close to Cloud Run.

Store the URL in Google Secret Manager as `DATABASE_URL`. A typical URL ends in
`?sslmode=require`. Do not put it in GitHub variables, workflow files, or
Cloudflare build variables.

With the checked-in defaults, two API instances times five pool connections
means at most ten application connections, plus provider/admin overhead. Lower
`DB_MAX_CONNS` if the database plan is smaller.

Migrations run on API startup, are transactionally serialized with a PostgreSQL
advisory lock, and use additive SQL. Take a backup before a destructive future
migration.

## 2. Cloud Run API

Build `apps/api/Dockerfile`. The final image runs as a non-root user and
contains `/app/api` plus the one-shot `/app/maintenance` command.

The checked-in `.github/workflows/deploy-api.yml` is manual-only. Configure a
GitHub `production` environment, require reviewer approval, and add these
repository variables:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | Google Cloud project |
| `GCP_REGION` | API and image region, usually `asia-southeast1` after checking database latency |
| `GCP_ARTIFACT_REPOSITORY` | Artifact Registry Docker repository |
| `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` | Full GitHub OIDC provider resource name |
| `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | Least-privilege deployer service account |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated production frontend origins |

Create Secret Manager secrets named `DATABASE_URL` and
`DLT_WORKFILTER_TOKEN`. Grant the Cloud Run runtime identity access only to
those secrets. The GitHub workflow uses Workload Identity Federation; do not
create a long-lived service-account JSON key.

The deployment defaults are deliberately small:

- request-based billing;
- minimum instances `0`, maximum instances `2`;
- 1 vCPU, 256 MiB;
- Cloud Run concurrency `20`;
- at most four simultaneous DLT calls per API instance;
- five PostgreSQL connections per API instance.

The service exposes:

- `/healthz`: process liveness, independent of PostgreSQL;
- `/readyz`: PostgreSQL-backed readiness;
- `/docs`: OpenAPI UI.

Set a Cloud Run startup probe to `/healthz` and a liveness probe to `/healthz`.
Use `/readyz` from external monitoring so a disconnected database is visible.

## 3. Static frontend with the full BFF

If the full BFF is deployed separately, any static host may use these settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Root directory | `apps/web` |
| Build command | `npm ci && npm run build` |
| Build output | `out` |
| Node version | `26` (or the exact `.nvmrc` version) |

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to the public Cloud Run URL and
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to the canonical HTTPS site origin before building.
Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SLOT_TOOLS_ENABLED=true` only after the BFF slot, comparison
and history endpoints are deployed and verified.
Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME` to the selected public brand. These are public
browser values, not secrets. Configure the same
Pages/custom-domain origin in `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Builds without a site URL
deliberately emit `noindex` metadata to prevent an accidental preview from
competing with production.

The static `_headers` file supplies basic browser security headers and
immutable caching for content-hashed Astro assets. Its referrer policy
preserves the origin required by OpenStreetMap's public tile usage policy.

Deploy previews must either use a separately allowed API origin or accept that
browser CORS calls will be blocked. Avoid a wildcard production origin.

## 4. Retention maintenance

Run the same image as a one-shot Cloud Run Job with command
`/app/maintenance`. Give it the runtime database secret and these optional
variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `SLOT_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` | 365 | Delete older raw slot observations |
| `FETCH_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` | 30 | Delete older operational fetch records |

Schedule the job weekly with Cloud Scheduler after one manual successful run.
The command is idempotent and exits after one bounded transaction; it is not an
always-on worker. Identical slot payloads are already collapsed inside a
six-hour heartbeat, while changed payloads remain separate observations.

## 5. Monitoring and low-attention operation

At minimum:

- uptime check `/healthz` and database-aware check `/readyz`;
- alert on sustained 5xx responses, readiness failures, and instance saturation;
- log-based alert for repeated `DLT upstream returned status` errors;
- monthly cloud budget and anomaly alerts;
- database storage, connection, backup, and restore alerts;
- weekly dependency pull requests and required CI.

Run a restore rehearsal before launch and at least quarterly. A backup that has
never been restored is not a verified recovery plan.

## 6. Rollback

1. Stop the rollout if `/healthz` or `/readyz` fails.
2. Send Cloud Run traffic back to the previous healthy immutable revision.
3. Roll Cloudflare Pages back to the previous deployment independently.
4. Keep the previous revision database-compatible. Do not reverse a migration
   during an incident unless a tested recovery procedure requires it.
5. If data is damaged, isolate writes, preserve logs, and restore into a new
   database before changing the production URL.

## 7. Domain or full-BFF loss

Licence and office content is statically exported and does not require a live
API to build. Interactive tools still depend on the configured Go API;
PostgreSQL fallback cannot help if that API itself is unavailable.

The `workers.dev` site and committed office capture are the domain-independent
fallback. They do not provide offline mode, live slots, stored slot history or
automatic failover for the future Go service.

## Environment contract

| Variable | Default | Runtime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `8080` | Cloud Run API port; overrides `API_PORT` |
| `API_PORT` | `8080` | Local API port fallback |
| `DATABASE_URL` | local Compose URL | PostgreSQL connection |
| `DATABASE_REQUIRED` | `false` | Set `true` in production |
| `DB_MAX_CONNS` | `5` | Per-instance pool limit |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:3000` | Exact comma-separated browser origins |
| `DLT_API_BASE_URL` | current DLT host | Upstream base URL |
| `DLT_WORKFILTER_TOKEN` | empty | Opaque upstream work-filter value |
| `DLT_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | `4` | Per-instance upstream request cap |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | local dev: `http://localhost:8080`; production: empty for same origin | Build-time frontend API URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | empty (`noindex`) | Canonical site origin; required for a public indexed build |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME` | the name in `apps/web/src/shared/config/site.ts` | Public site name used in page metadata and homepage structured data |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SLOT_TOOLS_ENABLED` | `false` | Build-time capability gate; set `true` only for a verified full-BFF deployment |
